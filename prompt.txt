**Prompt for Cryptographic Inventory Analysis**

As a cryptography expert, your task is to analyze the cryptographic inventory of various servers and produce a report with two parts: (1) a checklist for verification and hardening of traditional cryptography, and (2) a checklist for using hybrid or post-quantum cryptography, based on the provided `inventory.txt` file. The `inventory.txt` file contains significant cryptographic details, but may lack specific information needed for a comprehensive analysis. You must create a two-step workflow: first, generate a bash script to collect only the additional information not readily available or obvious from `inventory.txt`, and second, produce the report after receiving the supplementary data. Follow these guidelines:

- **Step 1: Generate a Bash Script**
  - Thoroughly analyze the provided `inventory.txt` to identify specific gaps in information critical for the report. Examples of potential gaps include (but are not limited to):
    - Missing DNSSEC validation results for the server’s domain.
    - Unverified certificate trust chains or expiration details.
    - Incomplete service configurations (e.g., full web server settings, cipher preferences).
    - Unclear disk encryption status or device mapper mappings.
    - Insufficient details on entropy or random number generation (RNG) hardware.
    - Lack of information on post-quantum algorithm support in libraries like OpenSSL.
  - Based on the identified gaps, create a bash script (wrapped in an `<xaiArtifact>` tag with a unique `artifact_id`, titled `gather_info.sh`, and content type `text/bash`) that the user can run on their server via CLI to collect only this missing information. The script must:
    - Save output to `additional_info.txt`.
    - Include only commands necessary to address the specific gaps found in `inventory.txt`, avoiding duplication of existing data (e.g., OpenSSL version, SSH ciphers, firewall rules).
    - Be dynamically generated, with commands tailored to the server’s configuration as revealed by `inventory.txt`.
    - Use dynamic variables (e.g., `$(hostname)` for domain-specific commands) for portability.
    - Check for the presence of tools or files before execution, handling cases where they are absent.
    - Minimize user input, clearly indicate `sudo` requirements, and ensure robustness across different server setups.
  - Provide clear instructions for running the script and sharing the output.

- **Step 2: Produce the Report**
  - Once the user provides `additional_info.txt`, combine it with `inventory.txt` to generate the report.
  - The report must include:
    - **Part 1: Checklist for Verification and Hardening of Traditional Cryptography**
      - Verify cryptographic algorithms, key sizes, and protocols across components (e.g., SSH, TLS, web servers, databases).
      - Identify weak configurations (e.g., outdated ciphers, insecure protocol versions).
      - Recommend hardening steps (e.g., disable weak ciphers, enforce TLS 1.3, secure SSH, enable disk encryption).
    - **Part 2: Checklist for Using Hybrid or Post-Quantum Cryptography**
      - Assess current use of hybrid/post-quantum algorithms (e.g., in SSH or TLS).
      - Evaluate readiness of libraries (e.g., OpenSSL, GnuTLS) and kernel for post-quantum cryptography.
      - Recommend steps to adopt quantum-resistant algorithms (e.g., hybrid key exchanges, monitoring NIST standards).
  - Ensure recommendations are actionable and tailored to the server’s configuration.

- **Prompt Output**
  - Provide a clear workflow description with Step 1 and Step 2.
  - In Step 1, include the bash script in an `<xaiArtifact>` tag, with commands dynamically determined based on the analysis of `inventory.txt`, not hardcoded or predefined.
  - In Step 2, describe the report structure without generating it (await user’s submission of `additional_info.txt`).
  - Ensure the prompt is generic, reusable across servers, and relies on `inventory.txt` as the primary data source, with the bash script targeting only missing or ambiguous details.

Please use the attached "inventory.txt" as the starting point of your analysis.

Please generate and follow the two-step workflow, including a bash script with commands dynamically tailored to collect only the additional information needed beyond what `inventory.txt` provides, and outline the report structure. If clarification is needed, ask the user before proceeding.
